Rahul Dravid, often referred to as "The Wall" of Indian cricket, is celebrated as one of the most technically proficient and mentally resilient batsmen in the history of the game. Born on January 11, 1973, in Indore, India, Dravid's cricketing journey is marked by his unwavering dedication, classical batting technique, and a career that spanned over a decade and a half, making him a legendary figure in the cricketing world.

Dravid made his Test debut for India on June 20, 1996, against England at Lord's. His debut innings of 95 runs showcased his immense potential and technical soundness. Over the years, he built a reputation as a reliable and consistent batsman, particularly in Test cricket. Known for his ability to anchor the innings, Dravid often played the role of a stabilizer in the Indian batting lineup, allowing more aggressive players to flourish around him.

One of the defining features of Dravid's career was his ability to adapt to different formats of the game. While he was predominantly known for his exploits in Test cricket, where he amassed over 13,000 runs at an average of 52.63, he also made significant contributions in One Day Internationals (ODIs). Dravid scored more than 10,000 runs in ODIs and was known for his ability to play the sheet-anchor role, rotating the strike and building partnerships. His versatility was further exemplified when he took on the role of wicketkeeper-batsman during the early 2000s, allowing India to field an extra batsman.
